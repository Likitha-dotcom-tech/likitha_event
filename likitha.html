<p>Maariyappan "Maari" is a fun-loving gangster whose sidekicks are Sanikkizhamai and Robert, alias Adithangi (punching bag). Maari is chased around by Araathu Aanandi, an auto rickshaw driver who is totally in love with him. However, despite her efforts, he does not give her a second glance and constantly shows his annoyance toward her.

    Meanwhile, gangster Gangadhar Beeja alias "Thanatos" escapes from prison after killing two officers. He is out for vengeance against Maari as his brother, a defence lawyer, promised to get Beeja released from prison. However, his brother is killed at the hands of Maari as the former tried to molest Aanandi's elder sister (unknown to Beeja). This is why Aanandi loves Maari. While returning from a party, Maari is attacked and Aanandi takes him to the hospital and takes care of him. Kalai's brother Vallavan is shown to be cooperating with Singayya, who has formed an alliance with Beeja to overthrow Maari.
    
    Per Beeja's plan, Vallavan asks Sani to send Aanandi for a job, which turns out to be drug smuggling. She unknowingly goes to do the job and gets caught by Kalai. Upon being confronted, she tells him that Maari asked her to do it. This sparks doubt for Kalai. Vallavan is caught by Maari carrying drugs, and when Maari confronts Kalai, a fight erupts. Maari and his sidekicks set fire to all the drugs, and Beeja kills Vallavan, making it look as though Maari killed him. Kalai becomes enraged and orders his men to kill Maari, who is injured in the battle. Beeja reveals himself as the perpetrator and shoots Maari, but he is saved by Aanandi, who takes the bullet for him, which ends up in her spinal cord, paralysing her for life.
    
    Vijaya Chamundeshwari is the newly appointed District Collector, who comes out to restore order and stop all gang violence. Maari goes into hiding with Aanandi, whose legs are paralysed. Eight years pass, and Beeja and Kalai have grown to become powerful gangsters, but when Kalai has a chance to become a legislative candidate of the ruling party, Beeja takes the opportunity to threaten Kalai and his family. Vijaya, now the Deputy Home Secretary, in an effort to find Maari, posts his picture along with Aanandi's in newspapers. Maari meets Vijaya and requests that she remove the photos. He then reveals that he was living in Tenkasi with an elderly couple</p>
<p>Maari and Aanandi get married, Aanandi gets pregnant, and a healthy baby boy is born. However, due to complications from paralysis, Aanandi dies minutes after childbirth. Maari then raises the boy, called Kaali, with help from the old couple, Sani and Robert. Kaali is shown to have inherited Maari's behaviour and keeps picking fights in school. Maari then requests Vijaya stop coming after him as he has changed his ways. When Kaali sees some students teasing a teacher, he complains about them to the principal. In retribution, the boys chase and attack him, only to get beaten by Kaali. The local council member, who is also the father of one of the boys, summons Kaali in order to beat him up, but Maari goes and begs for forgiveness.

    Meanwhile, the city police commissioner mentions to the media that there is an informant within Beeja's gang. Using his moles in the police department, Beeja tries to figure out who the mole is but fails. It is then revealed that there was no mole and that the whole story was fabricated to identify corrupt policemen in the department, including the commissioner. Further, it is revealed that Beeja has had ties with the commissioner and was the mole himself.[contradictory] He had been leaking information about his men in order to clear his name and become a candidate.</p>
